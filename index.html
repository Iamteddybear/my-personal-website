  <h1>The First Dungeon Master</h1>
  <h2>Early Life</h2>
  <img src="./images/gary gygax young.webp" alt="gary">
  <p>Gygax was born in Chicago, the son of Almina Emelie "Posey" and Swiss immigrant and former Chicago Symphony
    Orchestra violinist Ernst Gygax. He was named Ernest after his father, but he was commonly known as Gary, the middle
    name given to him by his mother after the actor Gary Cooper. The family lived on Kenmore Avenue, close enough to
    Wrigley Field that he could hear the roar of the crowds watching the Chicago Cubs play. At age 7, he became a member
    of a small group of friends who called themselves the "Kenmore Pirates". In 1946, after the Kenmore Pirates were
    involved in a fracas with another gang of boys, his father decided to move the family to Posey's family home in Lake
    Geneva, Wisconsin, where Posey's family had settled in the early 19th century, and where Gary's grandparents still
    lived.

    In this new setting, Gygax soon made friends with several of his peers, including Don Kaye and Mary Jo Powell.
    During his childhood and teen years, he developed a love of games and an appreciation for fantasy and science
    fiction literature. When he was five, he played card games such as pinochle and then board games such as chess. At
    the age of ten, he and his friends played the sort of make-believe games that eventually came to be called "live
    action role-playing games" with one of them acting as a referee.[15] His father introduced him to science fiction
    and fantasy through pulp novels. His interest in games, combined with an appreciation of history, eventually led
    Gygax to begin playing miniature war games in 1953 with his best friend Don Kaye. As teenagers Gygax and Kaye
    designed their own miniatures rules for toy soldiers with a large collection of 54 mm and 70 mm figures, where they
    used "ladyfingers" (small firecrackers) to simulate explosions.

    By the time he reached his teens, Gygax had a voracious appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard,
    Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a
    few months after his father died, he dropped out of high school in his junior year. He joined the Marines, but after
    being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he received a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From
    there, he commuted to a job as a shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a
    friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg. Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing
    marathon sessions once or more a week. It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hex mapping
    sheets available, which he then employed to design his own games.</p>

  <h2>Wargames and early days</h2>
  <p>In 1967, Gygax co-founded the International Federation of Wargamers (IFW) with Bill Speer and Scott Duncan. The IFW
    grew rapidly, particularly by assimilating several pre-existing wargaming clubs, and aimed to promote interest in
    wargames of all periods. It provided a forum for wargamers, via its newsletters and societies, which enabled them to
    form local groups and share rules. In 1967, Gygax organized a 20-person gaming meet in the basement of his home;
    this event would later be referred to as "Gen Con 0". In 1968, Gygax rented Lake Geneva's vine-covered Horticultural
    Hall for US$50 (equivalent to $390 in 2021) to hold the first Lake Geneva Convention, also known as the Gen Con
    gaming convention for short. Gen Con is now one of North America's largest annual hobby-game gatherings. Gygax met
    Dave Arneson, the future co-creator of D&D, at the second Gen Con in August 1969.

    Late in October 1970, Gygax lost his job at the insurance company after almost nine years. Unemployed and now with a
    family of five childrenâ€”Ernest ("Ernie"), Lucion ("Luke"), Heidi, Cindy, and he tried to use his enthusiasm for
    games to make a living by designing board games for commercial sale. This clearly proved to be unsustainable when he
    only grossed $882 in 1971 (equivalent to $5,902 in 2021). He began cobbling shoes in his basement, which provided
    him with a steady income and gave him more time for pursuing his interest in game development. In 1971, he began
    doing some editing work at Guidon Games, a publisher of wargames, for which he produced the board games Alexander
    the Great and Dunkirk: The Battle of France. Early that same year, Gygax published Chainmail, a miniatures wargame
    that simulated medieval-era tactical combat, which he had originally written with hobby-shop owner Jeff Perren. The
    Chainmail medieval miniatures rules were originally published in the Castle & Crusade Society's fanzine The Domesday
    Book. Guidon Games hired Gygax to produce a "Wargaming with Miniatures" series of games, and a new edition of
    Chainmail (1971) was the first book in the series. The first edition of Chainmail included a fantasy supplement to
    the rules. These comprised a system for warriors, wizards, and various monsters of non-human races drawn from the
    works of J. R. R. Tolkien and other sources. For a small publisher like Guidon Games, Chainmail was relatively
    successful, selling 100 copies per month.

  <h2>The first edition & a successful launch</h2>
  <img src="./images/first edition dm guide.jpg" alt="The first edition">
  <p>The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, released in 1977, was an introductory version of the original D&D geared towards
    new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes. In the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex
    version of D&D, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D). The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first
    supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. The AD&D rules were not fully compatible with
    those of the D&D Basic Set and as a result, D&D and AD&D became distinct product lines. Splitting the game
    lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D&D
    products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD&D books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979,
    Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would
    receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD&D products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next
    decade.

    Gygax wrote the AD&D hardcovers Players Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide, Monster Manual, and Monster Manual II.
    Gygax also wrote or co-wrote numerous AD&D and basic D&D adventure modules, including The Keep on the Borderlands,
    Tomb of Horrors, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, The Temple of Elemental Evil, The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun,
    Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure, Isle of the Ape, and all seven of the modules later combined into Queen of the
    Spiders. In 1980, Gygax's long-time campaign setting of Greyhawk was published in the form of the World of Greyhawk
    Fantasy World Setting folio, which was expanded in 1983 into the World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting boxed set.
    Sales of the D&D game reached US$8.5 million in 1980. Gygax also provided assistance on the Gamma World science
    fantasy role-playing game in 1981 and co-authored the Gamma World adventure Legion of Gold.</p>
